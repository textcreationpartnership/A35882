            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN London &amp; Oxford.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>London,</speaker>
               <p>WHY ſo haſty to let thy Lodgings, before thou knoweſt what their Perſons, and their Principles are? What if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Number of <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould lodge in thy Bowels, and when occaſion ſerves, be the firſt that will flye in thy Face? Let me tell thee, a <hi>Papiſt</hi> Maſquerade looks ſo Saint-like, that the moſt Learned in your Univerſity will be puzled to diſcover him; he will go to the Church, or to the Meeting, commend either, or both; ſay any thing, do any thing, or Swear any thing to pleaſe you, or to gain your good Opinion of him; but as ſoon as ever the Muzle is taken from the Maſtive's Head, then he flyes at your Throat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oxford,</speaker>
               <p>If it be not too late, I'le be as Induſtrious as I can to prevent them from lurking in my Territories hereafter. I have already got a Jolly Company of New Tenants, but what they are, I know no more than the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> nay, for ought I know, he knows them better than I do; I am ſure they have <hi>Proteſtant Outſides,</hi> they go to Church, and take as much Bread and Wine as the Perſon thinks well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them. I ſee neither Beads nor Bullets; if they have any ſtore, for ought I know, they may do as the <hi>Jews</hi> (in <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> dayes) did with their Jewels, hide them in their Bellyes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>London,</speaker>
               <p>Watch them as narrowly as the Cats do Mice; if there be any ill Deſign afoot, either by Night or by Day, you'l ſee ſome Symptoms of it; there is ſeldom any Smoke, but there is ſome Fire. Hitherto their Plots have been fruitleſs enough; they can hardly boaſt of more than two or three Juſtices of Peace being Kill'd; they have been defeated in all their Attempts in my Liberties; Let them not gain the Ground in thine, which they have loſt in mine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oxford,</speaker>
               <p>A word to the wiſe is enough; but let me tell thee, I am the leſs Sollicitous and Carefull, becauſe I know his Majeſty will for his own Safety, and our Security, bring a ſufficient Number of Red-Coats with him: I pray God they be good ones.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>London,</speaker>
               <p>I hope they will: But what means the bleating of theſe Sheep? What means all this Noiſe? What creates theſe Fears, and begets theſe Jealouſies in the People? They ſeem to fear, that neither the <hi>King</hi> nor the <hi>Parliament</hi> may be in ſafety there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oxford,</speaker>
               <p>I believe this Fear may proceed from a Principle of Love; thoſe we love well, we never think them ſafe enough. The King's greateſt Enemies will call him, <hi>A good Natured King;</hi> and well they may; if he has any fault, this is his Crime, that he is too apt to forgive his Enemies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>London,</speaker>
               <p>I wiſh the thoughts of this doth not animate our Red-lettered Villains the more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oxford,</speaker>
               <p>Be not over-jealous, we are like to have moſt of the ſame Members to fit again, and all will grant them to be Wiſe, Diſcreet, Learned, Sober, Judicious, Unbyaſſed men; if they are ſo zealous for the good of their Country, ſurely in the midſt of their zeal, they will not be unmindfull of their own ſafety.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb facs="tcp:48955:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <speaker>London,</speaker>
               <p>I wiſh they may not; our Happyneſs or Miſery depends on their Weal or Wo; whilſt they ſwim, we can never ſink; they are the Pillars on which all our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations reſt; their Sorrow is our Sorrow, and their Delight is ours; we are the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Eyes, and they are tender over us. God bleſs and preſerve the King's moſt Excellent Majeſty, and unite his Royal Heart to ſuch faithful Counſellors as they have been.</p>
               <p>Go grant that his Ahithophel Counſellors may be brought to Confuſion, may his ſecret Enemies be brought to open Shame, and may his Sacred Ears be ever open to thoſe that Counſel him for Good.</p>
               <l>Then we ſhall ſee the Pope will hang his Ears,</l>
               <l>His Imps will all be filled with Shame and Fears:</l>
               <l>Terrors will hunt them into ev'ry Cave,</l>
               <l>And he'l be Happy'ſt that firſt finds his Grave.</l>
               <l>Now they may prick their Ears, and laugh a While,</l>
               <l>But then they'l have but little cauſe to Smile:</l>
               <l>Their preſent Joy to Mourning will be Turn'd;</l>
               <l>They may be Hang'd that thought we ſhould be Burn'd.</l>
               <l>O bleſs my Eyes, great God above, I pray Thee,</l>
               <l>With ſuch a Change, and I will ſtrive to pay Thee</l>
               <l>With Thanks and Praiſes: Let me ſee this Sight,</l>
               <l>And thou ſhalt be my God, and my Delight.</l>
               <l>Pity thy <hi>Sion's</hi> Sorrows, they are great;</l>
               <l>Pull down the Tripple Crown from <hi>Sion's</hi> Seat:</l>
               <l>Shut up the Flood-Gates of her flowing Eyes;</l>
               <l>Arm thee with Strength, O God, and now ariſe.</l>
               <l>Root up the <hi>Roman</hi> Pride, build <hi>Sion's</hi> Wall;</l>
               <l>Thy People cannot riſe till <hi>Rome</hi> doth Fall.</l>
               <l>Unite our Sacred King and Parliament,</l>
               <l>And thus pluck off our Clouds of Diſcontent.</l>
               <l>Be thou our God, and O be thou our Guide!</l>
               <l>Then we have Strength and Council on our Side.</l>
               <l>Then let them Plot, it ſtands to Senſe and Reaſon,</l>
               <l>Their Plots will be but like their Powder-Treaſon;</l>
               <l>Their Stratagems and Plots will Fade and Ceaſe,</l>
               <l>We ſhall be Happy in a Laſting Peace.</l>
